Recommendations
1. Jan performed least for the year and I do  recommend to the stakeholders that he be retrenched or sent over for some training on sales and customer retention.
2. Nancy performed best for the year and  I recommend Nancy for a promotion to encourage her and others to do more.
3. Recommend company D for discount in the coming year to encourage more purchase or make them the company of the year.
4. Sales for the month of february was very low compared to other months, i do recommend to check what caused it, so as to prevent a recurrence in the future and i also  recommend that the stakeholders replicate measures implemented in december for months with low turn out
5. I recommend the top 10 countries to be given gifts at the end of the year to encourage them more.
6. Study what makes the north successful and do the same for the west. Find the salesperson resident in the Northern region, inquire measures implemented and convey this to the sales person in the west. 
7. I recommend that the stakeholders inform all inventory staff to keep an eye on the beverages in the coming year so that it does not get to deplete at any time.
8. The higher priced products were less popular among the customers, so the stakeholders should give a flexible payment plan for the higher priced goods to encourage customers to buy them, and I do recommend the stakeholders should invest in advertisements of the high priced goods more.
9. Set up a sub headquarters at New York so that more customers there will patronize more as a result of low shipping fees.
